# kilo
## a single file, raw mode text editor in < 1000 lines of code.

As the title suggests this is a simple text editor written in C. I would love to take credit and say that all this code is my own work, but I essentially followed the guide at  https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/.

This project was a lot of fun, and it was interesting to see the, well, _incantations_ one has to do in order to get a terminal into raw mode.

### Installation: 
`$ make`

Gosh, makes you miss the old days of software development, huh?

### Usage
`./kilo <filename>`

Ctrl-S = save | Ctrl-Q = quit | Ctrl-F = find
